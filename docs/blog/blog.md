# Blog: Password Manager

**Dean Lynch**

## Blog Entry 1 - Fri 11 October:

Last week I organised a meeting with Brian Stone to have a talk about my proposed project idea. 
Brian liked the idea and agreed to be my project supervisor. 

Brian confirmed himself as my project supervisor and completed my project proposal ahead of the deadline today.

## Blog Entry 2 - Wed 18 October:

This week I had my first official meeting with Brian. 
We have organised to meet up every Wednesday at 12 with the other students that Brian is supervising.

Tom was also present at the meeting. 
It was very interesting to hear about Toms project which involves comparing images and determining how similar they are.

The main point that I took from the meeting with Brian was that my project had plenty of breadth, but said I needed to ensure that I had good depth in one area such as the encryption or synchronisation. 
I will meet again with Brian next week.

## Blog Entry 3 - Wed 24 October:
Today I had my proposal presentation. 
My two assesors were Andrew McCarren and Liam Tuohey.
Neither Liam or Andrew use a password manager, so it was a little harder to explain to them why my password manager was different from the ones available on the market currently.
Both assessors seemed to be satisfied with my proposal and it was approved.

The one area Andrew was worried about was access to the database. 
He wasn't comfortable with only a single password protecting the entire database.
He would like if some sort of two-factor authentication is enforced by the application.

## Blog Entry 4 - Wed 31 October:
This week I started working on my functional specification. 
I have another 3 assignments ongoing at the moment, so it's quite difficult to find time for the project.

## Blog Entry 5 - Wed 07 November:
This week I continued to work on other assignments and made good progress in particular on the Compiler construction assignment.
I was able to find some time to make a little more progress on the functional specification.

I also spent some time researching how other password managers handle the concern that Andrew McCarren had in my project proposal.
After speaking with Brain at my weekly supervision meeting, we decided that enforcing two factor authentication for every user would be a good solution to this problem.

## Blog Entry 6 - Wed 14 November:
This week I continued working on my functional specification. 
In the process of working on this I discovered research papers about password database formats and usage of password managers in enterprise.

Brian was worried that I hadn't been working on writing code on the project, as he feels that this would keep the project fresh in my mind. 
So next week I hope to get started on implementing the project as well as making more progress on the functional specification.

## Blog Entry 7 - Wed 21 November:
Our functional specification deadline was pushed back due to overlapping of assignment deadlines from other modules. 
I was quite happy about this as it would give more time for me to work on implementing the project alongside working on the functional specification.

I also discovered a Java library called KeePassJava2 that should allow me to use the open source and very commonly used KDBX format with my password manager. 
This could potentially save me time that would be spent trying to create my own sort of implementation of a password database file.
More importantly, this could save me the potential security pitfalls I might introduce trying to implement my own database format.

## Blog Entry 8 - Wed 28 Novermber:
This week I finished my functional specification ahead of the deadline this coming Friday. 
In the little time I had to work on my implementation, I used it to continue work on the reading and writing of the database files, as well as writing unit tests to cover it.
