# PW-P2P - Password Manager with P2P Synchronization

DCU CASE4 final year project

Imported from http://gitlab.computing.dcu.ie/

This is a unique application that combines password database management and synchronisation into a unified application. The application reads from a locally stored password database file, which can then be synchronised across a users devices using a peer-to-peer connection. This eliminates the need to expose the password database to third-party servers or cloud storage services, as well as saving the user the need to manually synchronise the database or manage their own self-hosted solution.
